## Description:

Building Facebook clone. As usual, any additional styling will be up to you but the really important stuff is to get the data and back end working properly. You’ll put together some of the core features of the platform – users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking”. You’ll also implement sign-in with the real Facebook by using Omniauth and Devise.

## Environment:
- [ ] Ruby on Rails version 5.1.7
- [ ] bcrypt version 3.1.12 ([bcrypt()](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) allows you to easily harden your application against these kinds of attacks.)
- [ ] ([bootstrap-sass](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/bootstrap-sass/3.3.6) is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap 3, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications version 3.3.7
- [ ] Puma: A Ruby Web Server Built For Concurrency version '3.9.1'

## Getting started:
To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

```
$ rspec
```
$ rails generate rspec:install
